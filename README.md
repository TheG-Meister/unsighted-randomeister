# Unsighted Randomeister

Unsighted Randomeister is a randomiser mod for UNSIGHTED. Currently very early in development, this plugin only contains a seed-based item randomiser for the game's chests. It is uncommon to be able to complete a seed without extensive game knowledge, and many seeds would be impossible if crafting without a blueprint was disabled.

We have lots of ideas for future development, including but not limited to:
* Preventing crafting without a blueprint
* Preset and customisable item pools
* Reducing the number of (and eventually eradicating) impossible seeds
* More random item locations
* Difficulty settings
* Randomising exits, blueprints and enemies

In order to build some of these features, we'll need additional capabilities such as:
* File IO
* Player movement logging
* GUI
