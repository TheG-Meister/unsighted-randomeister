# Unsighted Randomeister

Unsighted Randomeister is a randomiser mod for UNSIGHTED. Currently very early in development, this plugin only contains a basic "live" item randomiser in which a random item is picked from an item pool at the time a chest is opened. Currently it is possible, albeit unlikely for the player to get stuck, and the game occasionally locks up when obtaining some items.

We have lots of ideas for future development, including but not limited to:
* Seeds
* Preventing crafting without a blueprint
* Preset and customisable item pools
* Softlock prevention
* More random item locations
* Difficulty settings
* Randomising exits, blueprints and enemies

In order to build some of these features, we'll need additional capabilities such as:
* File IO
* Player movement logging
* GUI
