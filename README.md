Unsighted Randomeister is a randomiser mod for UNSIGHTED. Currently part-way through development, it contains the following:
* A seed-based chest randomiser with 2 different item pools
* An upgraded, customisable chest radar
* Numerous options
* Simple softlock prevention
* Saving, loading and copying randomised data

A few more features are planned before release, including:
* A GUI
* Improving randomiser "logic"
* Randomising items from shops, NPCs, digging and fishing
* Requiring blueprints before crafting
* Patching glitches
* Opt-in movement logging

More long term there are lots of cool ideas such as random enemy spawns, random map transitions, bigger and better "logic", customisable game worlds and so much more. If you have any ideas, feel free to share them by opening an Issue!
